====== [ SETUP ] ======

1. Look for "bin/minecraft.jar" in your Minecraft folder.
  (Need help? => http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Installing_Mods#How_to_Find_Your_minecraft.jar_File)
  
2. Make sure ModLoader is already installed, and minecraft.jar's META-INF folder has been deleted
  (ModLoader thread => http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=80246)

3. Copy all contents from the Zip (except the "doc" folder) in minecraft.jar using an archiving utility (7-Zip, WinRAR...)

4. Launch the game!

====== [ MYCRAFT SETUP ] ======

If you're using MyCraft Mod Manager, follow these steps instead:

1. Make sure ModLoader is already installed
  (ModLoader thread => http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=80246)

2. Put the Zip in Minecraft's "mods" folder (without renaming the Zip).

3. Launch the game through MyCraft!

======= [ USE ] =======

* Default sorting key is R, but you can map it in the Options menu. The middle click also works.
* At first launch, two configuration files will appear in the minecraft root folder. Open them to learn how to customize the mod!
