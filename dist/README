====== [ SETUP ] ======

1. Look for "bin/minecraft.jar" in your Minecraft folder.
  (Need help? => http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Installing_Mods#How_to_Find_Your_minecraft.jar_File)
  
2. Make sure ModLoader is already installed, and minecraft.jar's META-INF folder has been deleted
  (ModLoader thread => http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=80246)

3. Copy all contents from the mod's "files" folder in minecraft.jar using an archiving utility (7-Zip, WinRAR...)

4. Launch the game!

======= [ USE ] =======

* Default sorting key is E, but you can map it in the Options menu.
* At first launch, two configuration files will appear in the minecraft root folder. Open them to learn how to customize the mod!
