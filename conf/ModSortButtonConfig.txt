D LOCKED

======== [ HELP ] ========

# HOWTO
# Each line you type is a new constraint you add for sorting items.
# You can specify :
#   * a particular cell (ex: "D1 sword")
#   * a whole row (ex: "D sword")
#   * a whole column (ex: "1 sword")
# Rows are, by default, sorted from left to right, and columns from bottom to top.

# AVAILABLE KEYWORDS
# You can use any of the keywords found in the ModSortButtonTree.txt file.

# MODIFIERS

# SPECIAL RULES
# 'r' modifier = Reverse sort order for a row/column (ex: "Ar sword")
# LOCKED keyword = Locks a part of the inventory so that stuff doesn't go there (ex: "D LOCKED"). Is overrided by more specific rules ("D LOCKED" is overrided by "D1 swords")

# INVENTORY GRID
#     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
